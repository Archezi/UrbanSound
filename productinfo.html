                                <h4>Arsenal FC</h4>
                                <p>In late 1886, a gaggle of workers from the Woolwich Arsenal Armament Factory decided to form a football team. They called themselves Dial Square as a reference to the sundial atop the entrance to the factory.</p>
                                <p>On December 11, 1886, Dial Square romped to a 6-0 victory over Eastern Wanderers; the first game in their initial guise. Shortly afterwards the name ‘Royal Arsenal’ was adopted.
                                A group of players from Nottingham Forest joined the Club and this connection with the future European Cup winners would spawn Arsenal’s famous red shirts.</p>

                            <p>A group of players from Nottingham Forest joined the Club and this connection with the future European Cup winners would spawn Arsenal’s famous red shirts. The group approached their former club, who had been formed some 20 years earlier, for spare kit. Forest duly obliged and Arsenal, dipped in red, never looked back.</p>

                            <p>Arsenal floated between a handful of different pitches in the Plumstead area in their early years. They started life on Plumstead Common but, for their second season, Royal Arsenal rented the nearby Sportsman Ground on Plumstead Marshes.</p>

                            <p>It was here that the Club would enter the London Senior Cup for the first time. Although they were beaten by Barnes in Round Two the wheels were in motion. With increasing support, the Club rented the Manor Ground the following season.</p>

                            <p>Royal Arsenal’s first FA Cup appearance would take place here in 1889/90. During the same season Arsenal would secure a hat-trick of successes, winning the London Charity Cup, the Kent Senior Cup and the Kent Junior Cup.</p>

                                <p>The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse,[3] playing on a field near Fosse Road. The name Leicester City was adopted in 1919. They moved to Filbert Street in 1891 and played there for 111 years,[4] before moving to the nearby Walkers Stadium in 2002. They renamed the stadium the King Power Stadium after a change of ownership in 2011. </p>
                                <p>Leicester City were elected to the Football League in 1894. The club's highest ever finish was second place in the top flight, in Division One in 1928–29. The club holds a joint-highest seven second tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship), as well as one League One title..</p>

                            <p>Formed in 1884 by a group of old boys of Wyggeston School as "Leicester Fosse", the club joined the Football Association in 1890. Before moving to Filbert Street in 1891, the club played at five different grounds, including Victoria Park south-east of the city centre and the Belgrave Road Cricket and Bicycle Grounds. The club also joined the Midland League in 1891, and were elected to Division Two of the Football League in 1894 after finishing second. Leicester's first ever Football League game was a 4–3 defeat at Grimsby Town, with a first League win the following week, against Rotherham United at Filbert Street. The same season also saw the club's largest win to date, a 13–0 victory over Notts Olympic in an FA Cup qualifying game.<p>

The club's highest league position to date came in 1985–86 when they achieved third place in the then First Division.</p>
                                <p>Three West Ham players were members of the 1966 World Cup final-winning England team: captain Bobby Moore and goalscorers Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters.</p>
